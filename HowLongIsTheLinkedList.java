/*Problem - A loop in a linked list occurs when following the linked list chain brings you back where you started. For example,
 * link 1 points to link 2 which points to link 3 which points to lin1, to link2, to link3, to link1... and you go round in an infinite
 * loop. Each test case here involves asingle-ended singly-linked list with a potential loop. Output the size of the loop, or 0 if 
 * there is no loop. In the above example, the loop is of size 3(e.g. link1, link2, link3...repeating forever).
 * Input - There is no input. The linked list is created automatically
 * Ouput - Output an integer, either 0 if the linked list is empty r has no loop, or else >0 corresponding to the length of the loop
 * in the linked list.
